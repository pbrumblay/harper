# Trust set: every `@HarperFast/<team>` handle in this repo's
# `.github/CODEOWNERS`. Same set as the people we trust to review code,

# handles. External-org handles in CODEOWNERS are deliberately ignored
# — only HarperFast members are admitted.

# Inputs:
#   USERS_TO_CHECK     — newline-separated logins; ALL must pass.
#                        Empty / whitespace-only entries are skipped.
#   ADMIT_CLAUDE_BOT   — "true" admits `claude[bot]` without a team
#                        check (used by claude-review for AI-authored
#                        PRs from the issue-to-PR pipeline). Anything
#                        else requires team membership for every user.
#   DEFAULT_TOKEN      — token for the CODEOWNERS read (typically
#                        $GITHUB_TOKEN; needs `contents: read`).
#   ORG_TOKEN          — token for `orgs/.../teams/.../memberships/...`
#                        (App-installation token with `Members: Read`,
#                        scoped to this `authorize` job only).
#   GITHUB_REPOSITORY  — owner/repo (auto-set by GitHub Actions).
#   GITHUB_OUTPUT      — output file path.
#
# Outputs (to $GITHUB_OUTPUT):
